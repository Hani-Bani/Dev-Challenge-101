## Overview

Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- The demo is posted here in my Github page. feel free to comment and suggest!
- I had mixed emotions doing this project because I am just starting. I am few weeks old from the start of this journey and although I have learned alot of concepts in HTML and CSS, the process of putting the knowledge to use and honing it as a skill is tedious. I am glad to be able to recreate this page and will surely not be my last. 
- I learned a lot about float and when to use it, how to position the elements and how to make the design work. I would probably try to improve this project once I gain more skills in CSS and HTML. 
- One thing I think I can take away from the experience, "Dont give up just yet, you can make it work!"
